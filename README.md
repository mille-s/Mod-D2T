# Mod-D2T dataset : Multi-level dependency-based version of WebNLG+

This repo contains the code and resources for our INLG'23 short paper "Mod-D2T: A Multi-layer Dataset for Modular Data-to-Text Generation" (Simon Mille, François Lareau, Stamatia Dasiopoulou, Anya Belz).

Follow instructions in the cells of ModD2T.ipynb to generate the data. You can find the paper's English, French and Irish data already generated in the "conllu..." folders. Starting from the WebNLG XML files, or from the provided corresponding linguistic structures thaty can be downloaded from this notebook, you can use the code to recreate the data from scratch, or to produce variants of the data, e.g. for now without aggregations (at the predicate-argument and/or syntactic level) and/or without REG.
